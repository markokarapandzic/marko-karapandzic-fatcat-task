# Fat Cat Coders Full Stack Homework Assignment

This is a TypeScript app that showcases some basic React components. The goal was to refactor JavaScript to TypeScript, create a List component, create a CreateForm component for generating forms, and create a DynamicPage component for generating pages.

## Packages Used

-   **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
-   **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
-   **React Query**: A powerful data-fetching library for React, enabling server-state management.
-   **Yup**: A JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
-   **Formik**: A library for building forms in React with ease.
-   **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to a server.
-   **clsx**: A utility for constructing `className` strings conditionally.
-   **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
-   **Vite**: A fast development build tool that also supports modern JavaScript features.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To run the project, install the necessary packages using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn add
```

### Running the Project

After installing the packages, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn run dev
```

This will start Vite, which will transpile TypeScript and run the project on `http://localhost:3000`.
